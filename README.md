# TournamentML
A machine learning model and associated spreadsheet that automatically groups competitors into divisions and prints brackets. 

"Life isn't fair", so martial arts students should train to defeat opponents who are bigger and stronger. However, sports should be fair, so most martial arts tournaments are organized into divisions of similar athletes. 

Large and official tournaments such as the Olympics, national championships, etc set the divisions ahead of time, and athletes will generally cut weight or have to qualify through previous victories, point rankings, etc. 

Local tournaments can use those "regular" divisions, but this often results in a degraded customer experience (for instance, cutting to a lower weight division but no one is there so divisions are combined anyway, 9-10 year olds being grouped together even though their weights are far apart, when the 10 year old could have had a much better division with the 11 year olds, etc).
